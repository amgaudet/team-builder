## About
From user input, builds an HTML write up of a project team of the manager and included engineers and interns. Each employee type also displays additional information on their employee card.

## Description
On deployment, the user is prompted via inquirer to enter information for the required team manager and is then brought to a menu prompt to add either an engineer or intern to the project. If another employee is to be added, the user is prompted to enter the corresponding information for the employee type. Once all employees are added, the saved info is then compiled into an HTML document found in the output folder. 

## Installation
